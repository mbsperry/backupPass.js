Syncing to a phone works well to have access to\r\npasswords when away from the home computer, but what happens when\r\nthe phone battery dies or the phone gets lost?\r\n\r\nBackup.Pass attempts to address this issue by providing a small,\r\npersonal web server which can access the KeePass database. This is\r\nmeant to be a secure, *emergency* backup server.\r\n\r\n## Security\r\n\r\nbackup.pass is not meant to be used on a regular basis.\r\n\r\n- Five one-time use encryption keys are generated on setup.\r\n- Each key is used to encrypt a separate copy of the KeePass\r\nencryption key file. \r\n- Every time a key is used, it is deleted.\r\n- Once the KeePass database key file is decrypted, the user still must\r\nsupply the KeePass password to unlock the database.\r\n- After 3 incorrect attempts: \r\n   - The server shuts down.\r\n   - All remaining keyfiles are deleted.\r\n- Unencrypted Keepass database keys are not stored on the server.\r\n- The Keepass password is never stored in any form.\r\n\r\n\r\n## Dependencies\r\n\r\n- Express\r\n- KeePass.io\r\n- body-parser\r\n- node-tmp\r\n- cookierParser\r\n- express-session\r\n- helmet\r\n- csurf\r\n\r\nDevelopment dependencies:\r\n\r\n- mocha\r\n- should\r\n- supertest\r\n\r\n## Setup\r\n\r\n- Copy keepass database to `./keepass/keepass.kdbx`\r\n- Copy keepass database key file to `./do_not_include/key.key`\r\n- Build backup.pass keys:\r\n\r\n```bash\r\nnode setup.js production\r\n```\r\n\r\n- **Print and keep the one-time keys with you.** They won't do you any good unless you have them when you need them!\r\n\r\n## Run\r\n\r\n\r\n```bash\r\nnode app.js\r\n```\r\n\r\n- Requires running behind https capable proxy.\r\n- Or deploy to your favorite PaaS.\r\n\r\n## Options\r\n\r\nStored as env variables. If running locally, can be stored in\r\n`config.json`. See `lib/config.js` for details.\r\n\r\n- `NODE_ENV = 'production'`\r\n    - Stores encrypted keyfiles in `./keys/`\r\n    - Expects to run behind a proxy. \r\n- `NODE_ENV = 'test'`\r\n    - Stores encrypted keyfiles in `./testing/`\r\n    - Starts self-signed https server\r\n    - loads keepass database from `./keepass/testing.kdbx`\r\n- `REDIRECT`\r\n    - `default = false`: Redirects http requests to https. Default is to ignore all http requests.\r\n- `KEEPASS_PATH`\r\n    - Specifies alternate path for keepass database\r\n- `LOG_LEVEL`\r\n    - `Default: quiet`: Minimal logging to the console. Logins and error messages get logged to `log.txt`.\r\n    - `\"verbose\"`\r\n\r\n## Compatibility\r\n\r\n- Tested extensively in Chrome\r\n- use `/legacy` for a rather clunky version that works well in older browsers\r\n","google":"","note":"Don't delete this file!
